# sls-bookly
a simple book tracker app to use an example domain for playing around with different full-stack combos. Authors and Books are stored locally in mongo, with much of the data sourced from GoodReads (copy+paste, not via api integration).

while this was originally a sandbox for playing with serverless (hence sls-bookly), the motivation here is more for swapping different front-end layers in and out and keeping the express server backend intact
